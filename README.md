# Bimaru Solver

This project was a part of an artificial intelligence course. The goal is to create a program which solves the popular game Bimaru.

File "instances" contains examples of Bimaru's starting board (instancexx.txt), and the solved board (instancexx.out) for comparison. The format for input and output is based on _File Format Description for Unsolvable Boards for CSPLib_ written by Moshe Rubin (Mountain Vista Software), Dec 2005.
